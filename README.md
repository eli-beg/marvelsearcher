## 2-Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from https://nodejs.org and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

- Navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

  ` git clone https://github.com/eli-beg/marvelsearcher.git`

2. Install the required dependencies:

   `npm install`

3. Marvel API Configuration:

   To make the application work correctly, you'll need to obtain a public Marvel API key. Follow these steps:

   a. Go to the [Marvel Developer](https://developer.marvel.com) website and create an account or log in if you already have one.

   b. Once inside the developer platform, obtain your public and private Marvel API key.

   c. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your Marvel API key and a HASH of your public and private api key, as an environment variable:

   ````
     VITE_API_KEY=
     VITE_API_HASH=  ```
   ````

   - You can generate the hash of your api keys through a javascript library, or with a website that offers hash generation services like: https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/ .

4. Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can run the project locally with the following command:

   `npm run dev`
